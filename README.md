Hospital database system using python

It has three databases for keeping records of Doctors, Patients admitted and new Appointments to specific doctors. Here, for interaction purpose i have used Tkinter in python. You can change design very easily. 
Database used here is sqlite3 which is already present in python. If you have to use other databases do the settings and use it. Python is very flexible.
